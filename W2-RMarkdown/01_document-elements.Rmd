# Introduction

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Footnotes

## Insert text with some footnotes

Here is an inline footnote ^[Inlines notes are easier to write, since you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to type the note.]

# Tables

```{r}
knitr::kable(head( cars ), 
      digits = 2,
      caption = 'cars dataset')

knitr::kable(head(iris))
```




[^1]: Here is the footnote.
[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.
